Clear and fair scheduling is essential for preventing conflicts and maximizing each co-owner’s enjoyment. This chapter covers scheduling options, digital tools, and strategies for smooth coordination.

### **Scheduling Tips**

- Fixed and Rotating Schedules: Establish a base schedule that includes reserved time for each co-owner and flexibility for spontaneous trips.

- Peak Times: Develop a fair system for handling high-demand periods, such as rotating holiday slots.

- Guests: Agree on the terms for allowing people outside the co-ownership to captain the boat; with or without one of the co-owners being part of the trip.

- Digital Tools: Use a digital scheduling tool like Google Calendar, Trello or specialized apps like [Boatr](https://www.getboatr.com/download) to streamline planning and provide easy access to the boat’s availability.

Effective scheduling reduces misunderstandings and makes co-ownership more enjoyable for everyone.

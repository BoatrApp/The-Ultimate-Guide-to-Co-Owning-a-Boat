## **Setting Up a Co-Ownership Agreement**

An effective co-ownership agreement is the foundation of a successful partnership. This chapter provides an overview of key elements in the agreement, ensuring that responsibilities, expectations, and contingency plans are clear to all parties.

### **Essential Elements of the Agreement**

- Usage and Scheduling: Outline each co-owner's access rights, peak time rotations, and the process for booking the boat in advance.

- Financial Contributions: Specify the initial investment, monthly or annual expenses, and how costs will be split for maintenance, insurance, and unexpected repairs.

- Responsibilities and Duties: Detail each co-ownerâ€™s responsibilities, from cleaning to routine maintenance and emergency handling.

- Conflict Resolution: Include a clear process for resolving conflicts, whether through meetings, third-party mediation, or agreed-upon rules.

- Exit Strategy: Define the steps for a co-owner to exit the agreement, sell their share, or bring in a new co-owner, ensuring fairness for all involved.

A well-drafted agreement acts as a guide and reduces potential conflicts, helping co-owners stay aligned on expectations.

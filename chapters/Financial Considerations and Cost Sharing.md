Co-ownership makes boat ownership more affordable, but transparent financial planning is key to keeping everyone on the same page. This chapter dives into cost breakdowns and offers advice for tracking expenses and dividing costs fairly.

### **Financial Planning Tips**

- Set up a shared fund or account specifically for boat expenses, making it easier to track payments and contributions.

- Consider appointing one co-owner as the financial manager to handle transactions and report on the budget.

### **Main Costs to Consider**

- Initial Purchase: Decide on the ownership shares and contributions toward the purchase cost.

- Insurance and Registration: Outline annual costs for boat insurance and registration, ensuring all co-owners contribute.
